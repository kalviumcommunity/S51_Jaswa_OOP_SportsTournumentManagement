# Sports Tournament Simulation

## Overview

This project is a sports tournament simulation designed to demonstrate key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. The simulation models teams, matches, venues, and a tournament organizer, showcasing their interactions and behaviors in a sports tournament setting.

## Features

- **Teams**: Create and manage teams with unique IDs, names, and players.
- **Matches**: Schedule, play, and update scores for matches between teams.
- **Venues**: Manage venues with specific locations and capacities.
- **Tournament Organizer**: Schedule matches and update team standings.

## OOP Concepts Implemented

1. **Encapsulation**: Each class encapsulates its attributes and methods, managing its own data and behavior.
2. **Inheritance**: Create subclasses for specific types of teams, matches, and venues, inheriting general properties and methods from the parent classes.
3. **Polymorphism**: Method overriding in subclasses allows for different implementations of methods.
4. **Abstraction**: Abstract complex operations into simple methods, allowing users to interact with the system without needing to understand the internal workings.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sports-tournament-simulation.git


## Usage

1. Create teams and register them.
2. Schedule and play matches between the teams.
3. Manage venue capacities and attendance.
4. Organize the tournament, schedule matches, and update standings.

## Example

Here's a brief example of how to use the simulation:

1. Create teams.
2. Register teams.
3. Schedule a match.
4. Play the match and update the score.
5. Update team statistics.
6. Manage venue attendance.
7. Schedule and organize multiple matches, updating standings accordingly.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Make your changes and commit them (`git commit -m 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
5. Open a Pull Request.
